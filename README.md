# Punjabi-News-Sentiment-Analysis
1. Introduction 
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis of news articles written in the Punjabi language. In today’s digital era, there is an overwhelming volume of news being published online. Understanding the public sentiment embedded in this content is critical for a variety of domains:
Public Opinion Monitoring: Gauging people’s sentiment toward political events, government actions, or societal issues.
Market Research: Understanding consumer sentiment towards brands, products, or services featured in news articles.
Content Recommendation Systems: Enhancing user experience by promoting articles that align with reader sentiment preferences.
While sentiment analysis has matured significantly for high-resource languages like English, regional languages such as Punjabi face several challenges:
Limited Resources: Lack of pre-trained NLP models and language-specific tools.
Scarcity of Annotated Datasets: Very few publicly available labeled corpora for Punjabi.


Linguistic Complexity: Punjabi has unique grammar, script (Gurmukhi), idioms, and cultural context.
Project Objective
The primary objective is to build a robust system that can:
Read and process Punjabi news articles or headlines.
Extract textual features using language preprocessing techniques.
Classify sentiment into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.
Handle nuances of the Punjabi language, including word ordering and vocabulary.
Key Contributions
Manual Dataset Creation: The team manually curated and labeled a dataset from real-world Punjabi news sources.
Machine Learning Pipeline: Text vectorization using TF-IDF and model training using classifiers like Logistic Regression.
Evaluation Metrics: Comprehensive analysis using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Scalability Potential: The system lays the foundation for future use with deep learning models or transformer-based architectures for Punjabi.
This project not only explores technical implementation but also contributes toward inclusive NLP, ensuring lesser-resourced languages like Punjabi are represented in modern AI tools.
